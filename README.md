## documentation 

first I took the mockup image the divided it by components.\
Then I build 3 different components (Header,Result,ResultList).\
Since I need to move the state between two child components \
I am using redux as a state management tool\

tried material ui but imo its a bit too much for this kinda of application\
tried the new redux toolkits but was a bit confusing so was taking abit of my time also has a lot of abstractions\
so stuck with the old react-redux with thunk
